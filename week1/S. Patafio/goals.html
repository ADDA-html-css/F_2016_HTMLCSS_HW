		<h1>Sarah P</h1>
		<p>My name is Sarah and my goals for this class are as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Learn the differences between CSS, HTML, and other coding lingo</li>
			<li>Problem solve; figure out how to create my website using the class as a guidance but mostly through my own, independent research</li>
			<li>Become competent in HTML and CSS language</li>
			<li>Develop a foundation of skills so that I can try my hand at hacking/looking at the server side after I fully understand the client side</li>
		</ul>
