<body>
I grew up in a few different cities including Lima, Peru, Seattle, WA, Sydney, Australia, and Istanbul, Turkey. I was always fascinated by art growing up, but I knew that I wanted to direct my love for design to something with tangible and practical uses. This is a large part of the reason why I'm studying architecture now! I enjoy drawing, animation, running, yoga, science fiction, and exploring whatever city I'm in at the moment.
